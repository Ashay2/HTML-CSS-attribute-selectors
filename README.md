# HTML-CSS-attribute-selectors
I have created this file by using only HTML and CSS, in CSS as well i did'nt use that much classes but used the selectors  to style the page as it loooks i.e., stattic positon , relative postion, absolute position, fixed position (not used) 
4 type of position
1. ststic positon: by default position give to us when using HTML i.e., left side of website
2. relative position: we can set the position of the div element where it should appear by giving the top and left and right and bottom command
3. Absolute position: it will be set the position within th parent div position
4. 4. fixed position: it will apper in the web page whenever we scroll it
